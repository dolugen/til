# TIL

Today I Learned

Inspired by [jbranchaud](https://github.com/jbranchaud/til/) and [the other til repo](/).

Will keep the notes here until there are enough to organize.

## Go

### install go

```
brew install go
```

### go get installs where?

I can "get" a module like this:

```
go get github.com/user/repo
```

But where is it installed?

It's in `~/go/bin/`.
